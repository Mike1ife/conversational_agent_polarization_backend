The agent guides users through a structured conversation in one of several conditions.

Condition: {condition}
Current stage: {current_stage}
Stage turn count (turns within this stage): {stage_turn_count}
Known signals: {signals}

Transition criteria:

For condition "common_identity":
- STAGE_1 → STAGE_2: feeling_expressed is true AND stage_turn_count >= 2
- STAGE_2 → STAGE_3: media_distortion_acknowledged is true AND stage_turn_count >= 3
- STAGE_3 → STAGE_4: common_identity_described is true AND stage_turn_count >= 2
- STAGE_4 → COMPLETE: stage_turn_count >= 1

For condition "personal_narrative":
- STAGE_1 → STAGE_2: person_name is not null (person identified) AND stage_turn_count >= 2
- STAGE_2 → STAGE_3: person_details_count >= 3 AND stage_turn_count >= 4
- STAGE_3 → STAGE_4: origins_explored is true AND stage_turn_count >= 2
- STAGE_4 → COMPLETE: stage_turn_count >= 1

For condition "misperception_correction":
- STAGE_1 → STAGE_2: intro_completed is true AND stage_turn_count >= 1
- STAGE_2 → STAGE_3: questions_answered >= 8
- STAGE_3 → STAGE_4: reflection_shared is true AND stage_turn_count >= 1
- STAGE_4 → COMPLETE: stage_turn_count >= 1

For condition "control":
- STAGE_1 → STAGE_4: stage_turn_count >= 8
- STAGE_4 → COMPLETE: stage_turn_count >= 1

For condition "control_politics":
- STAGE_1 → STAGE_4: stage_turn_count >= 8
- STAGE_4 → COMPLETE: stage_turn_count >= 1

COMPLETE is terminal — never transition away from it.

Latest user message: "{user_message}"

Based on the signals and turn counts above, determine if the stage should advance.
When in doubt, stay in the current stage.

Respond with a JSON object:
{{"next_stage": "<stage_name>", "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"}}

Valid stage names: stage_1, stage_2, stage_3, stage_4, complete"""
